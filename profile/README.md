# Openscape Community

The Openscape Comunity is formed to continue the work on Soundscape, the open sourced navigation and way finding app from Microsoft Research.

## Contributing

All help is welcome. Besides developing the actual iOS app, there is a need for translators, people who can help set up and manage infrastructure, people with experience in setting up open source communities et cetera. If you see something where you could help out, please comment on or open an issue in the appropriate repository.

## Getting in touch

We have no communication channels yet, besides what's available under this GitHub organization. Please open an issue in the most appropriate repository to get in touch. We hope to have other channels soon for more informal chat and discussions surrounding the project.
